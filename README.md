# Unhandled Errors in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications:  missing error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of a route that doesn't handle potential errors during a database operation (or any other asynchronous operation).  This can lead to unexpected crashes or incomplete responses if the operation fails.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling, demonstrating best practices for handling errors gracefully in an Express.js application.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install Express.js.
3. Run `node bug.js`.  Simulate an error by making the database operation fail (e.g., by trying to access a non-existent database).
4. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see how the error should be handled properly.

## Lessons Learned

* Always handle potential errors in your route handlers using `try...catch` blocks or async/await with error handling.
* Provide informative error messages to the client or log errors for debugging purposes.
* Consider using a centralized error-handling middleware for cleaner error handling across your application.
